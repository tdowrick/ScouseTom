#Results

##System Characterisation
Resistor phantom measurements were carried out in order to assess the noise and drift characteristics of the system. A 32 channel phantom, developed by _SwissTom AG_, was used. Data was collected over **x** hours, with an **ykHZ** injection at **zAmps** **(ref figure)**. With average signal amplitude of **zzmV**, the mean noise value was **xx%/yymV** and drift was **xx%/yymV** over the entire period. The frequency response was measured over the range 1Hz-20kHz (**x** cycles at each frequency), with a current of **xxmA**. With a purely resistive test object, no change in voltage should be seen. The variation over the frequency range was **xxmV/yy%**.

##Modes

###Figures
* 4 pane figure, showing example data:
* convential EIT mode - Tanks \ref{nntankrec} , Rat stroke, Human Stroke (no images)
* Triggered - EPs rat cortex (mayo), Epilepsy Anna V, VEPS Anna WW
* MF - Rat Stroke, Nir Stroke, Tank (not yet)
* Characterisation - Freq response isch, Mayo freq ep


##Experimental Data
* Rat stroke - time difference data/some images maybe \ref{FigureA} \ref{dV}
* Human stroke - time difference/multi frequency
* Tank/phantom - images
* Nerve - EIT & Action potential
* Epilepsy -EIT & EEG
* Frequency response
