## Experimental Design

First, experiments were carried out in resistor phantoms to characterise the system using similar methods to those used to evaluate other systems in the literature, enabling comparisons to be drawn. Subsequently, experiments using the system in all four applications previously described, and the performance evaluated in each case. In some instances, the data were collected during the course of other studies, but evaluation of the performance of the system was not the focus in these cases. Thus further analysis was required to characterise the quality of the data, beyond successfully imaging the impedance changes of interest. 

The initial resistor phantom experiments were conducted to characterise the performance of the system across frequency, and to obtain measures similar to those quoted for other EIT systems. Direct comparisons are made difficult as the exact testing conditions and analyses are not always explicitly stated, e.g. load used, which measurements were included and how many repetitions were used in calculations. Therefore, we have chosen to use phantoms and measurement paradigms which represent realistic usage in brain EIT applications. Specifically, the injected current amplitudes complied with IEC 60601-1 \cite{IEC} safety limits, the number of measurements and the averaging time was chosen to match those used to collect data for real EIT reconstructions. Thus the results represent the realistic best case performance of the system  in a animal or human experiment, as opposed to the maximum achievable on a test bench.
