## Experimental Design

First, experiments were carried out in resistor phantoms to characterise the system, using similar methods to those used to evaluate other systems in the literature, enabling comparisons to be drawn. Subsequently, experiments using the system in all four applications described previously



Say why we did each experiment, and criteria of success.

table of each experiment - EEG system, current, freq, injections, electrodes, 

say we are either using data collected in existing studies or have deliberately chosen realistic currents and other parameters. Not ideal cases.
