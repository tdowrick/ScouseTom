## Experimental Design

First, experiments were carried out in resistor phantoms to characterise the system using similar methods to those used to evaluate other systems in the literature, enabling comparisons to be drawn. Subsequently, experiments using the system in all four applications previously described, and the performance evaluated in each case. In some instances, the data were collected during the course of other studies, but evaluation of the performance of the system was not the focus in these cases. Therefore analysis of these results and 



Say why we did each experiment, and criteria of success.

say we are either using data collected in existing studies or have deliberately chosen realistic currents and other parameters. Not ideal cases.
