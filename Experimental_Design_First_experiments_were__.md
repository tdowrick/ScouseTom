## Experimental Design

First, experiments were carried out in resistor phantoms to characterise the system, and to provide results with which to compare to other existing systems. 



Say why we did each experiment, and criteria of success.

table of each experiment - EEG system, current, freq, injections, electrodes, 

say we are either using data collected in existing studies or have deliberately chosen realistic currents and other parameters. Not ideal cases.
