\subsection{Reproducibility and recommendations for use}
All of the hardware designs, PCB layouts and associated software have been made available (see Appendix) to allow interested parties to replicate and modify the system. The ScouseTom system is quick to reproduce, as all but two components are commercially available, and the bespoke PCBs are simple compared to those used in other research EIT systems. Within the UCL group, assembly and testing of a new system once all the parts have been acquired can be performed with a week. The major expense is the appropriate EEG system, with the current source and custom PCBs costing around a quarter of the two systems used in this study. Therefore, the additional cost to those already performing electrophysiological experiments is minimal, as the system is compatible with most state-of-the-art EEG systems. Thus this system greatly reduces the cost and complexity for those interested in including impedance measurements into their experiments.
