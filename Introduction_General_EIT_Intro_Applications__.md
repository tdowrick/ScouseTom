#Introduction

## General EIT Intro & Applications (brain/nerve)

## Existing EIT Systems (SwissTom, KHU, Dartmouth, UCL Mk 2.5 etc)

A typical EIT system consists of a current source, voltage measurement unit, electrode array and some form of control/switching circuitry for controlling the measurement process. A sinusoidal current, of a defined amplitude and frequency, is injected through a pair of electrodes, with voltages measured at all electrodes. This process can be repeated for a number of different pairs of electrodes, producing a set of voltage measurements which can be used to reconstruct a conductivity profile of the target object.

## Motivation

The optimal measurement paradigm for EIT in human/rat brain has not been established. As such any EIT system for use in the head should be as versatile as possible, with features including: arbitrary control over current amplitude, frequency, injection time and protocol; variable number and type of electrodes (surface, depth, EEG) and custom data/signal processing, tailored to the particular application.

##Syste4m specs
* EEG simultaneous
* Low Freq w/ fine control
* Versatile sig pro - different experimental paradigms
* Simple to reconfigure mode of operation - software reconfigurable. elec platinastion, safety study (arb long injections), easy to connect and trigger off different things VEPs etc. OPEN SOURCE CODE
* Easily reproducable - off the shelf parts, and open source hardware mix. Make a new one in days rather than months of redisgn. Compare cost/time investment to other DIY systems (KHU etc). SwissTom or other purchasable systems dont do what we want
