#Introduction

* General EIT Intro & Applications (brain/nerve)

The optimal measurement paradigm for EIT in human/rat brain has not been established. As such any EIT system for use in the head should be as versatile as possible, with features including: arbitrary control over current amplitude, frequency, injection time and protocol; variable number and type of electrodes (surface, depth, EEG) and custom data/signal processing, tailored to the particular application.
