# Discussion
A new EIT system has been described which can be utilised in a range of experiments, particularly those involving EIT of the head or nerve. A key advantage of the ScouseTom system is the high level of control it offers over all aspects of the experimental process.

All of the hardware designs, PCB layouts and associated software have been made available (see Appendix) to allow interested parties to replicate and modify the system.

## Summary of results
Noise figures are XXYY
SNR is ZZZZ etc

Four main modes of operation have been utilised, facilitating EIT experiments into imaging of stroke, evoked potentials, epilepsy, activity in peripheral nerves, alongside a range of tank and phantom based investigations.

**comparison to other systems? phantom tests are a bit worse than KHU but about same as UCH. but this system aimed at low freqs and amps, so tests difficult to compare. aim of system is to be verstatile primarily**

## Technical issues
The use of EEG amplifiers for voltage recording limits the maximum frequency to 20kHz, which is sufficient for fast neural EIT, but may not be sufficient for other EIT applications. Additionally, the BioSemi and actiCHamp systems implement hardware antialiasing filters, which causes a reduced gain at higher frequencies \ref{freqresp}. Given that the frequency response of the gain is known, it can easily be accounted for when using multi-frequency data.


## Recommendations for use
