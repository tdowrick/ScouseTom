\label{STOverview} Overview of the ScouseTom system. The two bespoke PCBs (highlighted) control programming of the current source, multiplex the current injection channels and randomise the stimulation trigger with respected to the phase of the injected current. Voltages are recorded in parallel by the EEG system and stored on the PC for offline processing.
