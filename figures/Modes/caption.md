\label{Modes} Modes of operation of the ScouseTom EIT system. **Standard:** Initial dataset collected at time T0, used as reference for subsequent datasets. **Evoked Potentials:** Current continuously injected simultaneous to multiple stimuli, with full dZ signal obtained through coherent averaging. **MutliFrequency** Data sets collected at multiple frequencies, with initial frequency F0 used as reference for subsequent measurements at higher frequencies. **Characterisation** Injection frequency is incremented across total range of interest
