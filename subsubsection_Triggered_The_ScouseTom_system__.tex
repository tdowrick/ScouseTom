\subsubsection{Triggered}

The ScouseTom system was utilised in measurements of evoked activity in the rat somatosensory cortex, following electrical stimulation of the forepaw [need much more detail so clear on a standalone reading] \cite{Aristovich_2016} \cite{Vongerichten_2016}, with an increased number of electrodes, from 32 on a single hemisphere to 128 with 64 on each hemisphere [unclear state exactly how many electrodes and number of recordings with each. The stimuli delivered were 10 mA pulses 1 ms duration at a rate of 2 Hz, triggered by the ScouseTom controller.

Current was injected at 1.7 kHz with 50 $\mu$ A amplitude, for 30 seconds across a pair of electrodes, with voltages on 127 electrodes recorded in parallel using the ActiChamp ActiveTwo system with 25 kHz sampling rate. The voltages were demodulated with 1 kHz bandwidth, yielding 2 ms time resolution, and coherent averaging was performed on 60 500 ms trials centered around the time of stimulation. This process was repeated for c. 50 pairs of injection electrodes over the course of 25 minutes to produce a complete data set of c. 6000 voltages. EIT images were reconstructed at each 2ms time point in c. 80000 element hexahedral mesh, using the methodology outlined in \cite{Aristovich_2014}.
