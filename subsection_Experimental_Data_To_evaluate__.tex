\subsection{Experimental Data}

To evaluate the system experimentally and clinically, experiments were performed using each the four modes of operation. Certain methods were common across some experiments and are detailed here separately. 

\subsubsection{Scalp electrode preparation}
All recordings on the human scalp were performed using 32 commercial EEG electrodes (EasyCap, Germany), using the configuration described by \citet{tidswell2001three}, which includes 21 locations from the EEG 10-20 standard \cite{Jasper1958} and 11 additional electrodes. For these experiments, the locations were updated to match the nearest equivalents in either the 10-10 or 10-5 extensions \cite{Oostenveld2001}. Each electrode site was first cleaned with surgical spirit, then abraded using Nuprep gel (Weaver and Co., USA) before application of the electrode using Elefix paste (Nihon Kohden, Japan).
