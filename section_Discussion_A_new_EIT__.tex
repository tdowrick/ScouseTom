\section{Discussion}
A new EIT system has been described which can be utilised in a range of experiments, particularly those involving EIT of the head or nerve. A key advantage of the ScouseTom system is the high level of control it offers over all aspects of the experimental process. This versatility is as a result of the stable performance of the hardware across frequency and load, in particular the current source, which largely removes the need for protocol specific calibration.
