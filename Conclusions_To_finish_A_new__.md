# Conclusions - To finish

A new EIT system has been described which can be utilised in a range of experiments, particularly those involving EIT of the head or nerve. A key advantage of the ScouseTom system is the high level of control it offers over all aspects of the experimental process. Currently, four main modes of operation have been established, facilitating EIT experiments into imaging of stroke, evoked potentials, epilepsy, activity in peripheral nerves, alongside a range of tank and phantom based investigations.

All of the hardware designs, PCB layouts and associated software have been made available (see Appendix) to allow interested parties to replicate/modify the system.
