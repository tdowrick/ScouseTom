\subsection{Summary of results}
The system meets with all the criteria described as a reconfigurable system adaptable to a variety of fast neural and brain EIT applications, whilst allowing for extensive control over the measurement setup and data processing. The utilisation of system in four main modes of operation has been outlined, facilitating EIT experiments into time imaging of stroke, multi-frequency stroke type classification, stimulation-triggered evoked potentials.
