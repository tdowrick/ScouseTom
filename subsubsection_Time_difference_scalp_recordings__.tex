\subsubsection{Time difference - scalp recordings}
The signal amplitude across all subjects was 5.4 mV $\pm$ 1.97 mV, and the drift during all recordings was 15.1 $\mu$V or 0.26 \%. The noise overall across all subjects was 37.2  $\mu$V $\pm$ 39.0 $\mu$V, or 


The mean noise across all 540 measurements and 60 repeats ranged from 8.55 $\mu$V to 53.9 $\mu$V between patients,


 The equivalent SNR was 46.5 dB $\pm$ 4.14 dB, ranging from 41.6 to 56.0 dB between subjects. 
 
 
 
 The degradation of the SNR using scalp electrodes is in agreement with previous studies \cite{fabrizi2007analysis} which demonstrated system noise accounts for approximately 5 \%, with physiological noise dominating. As with the long term resistor phantom recordings, the drifts across the recordings reduced the equivalent SNR. Additionally, artefacts resulting from subject or electrode movement were present some recordings, further reducing the effective SNR in these cases.
