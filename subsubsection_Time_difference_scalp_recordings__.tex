\subsubsection{Time difference - scalp recordings}
The signal amplitude across all subjects was 5.4 mV $\pm$ 1.97 mV, and the drift during all recordings was 15.1 $\mu$V or 0.26 \%. The noise overall across all subjects was 37.2 $\mu$V $\pm$ 39.0 $\mu$V, or 0.71 \% $\pm$ 0.65 \%. The mean noise between subjects was 8.55 $\mu$V to 53.9 $\mu$V, 0.18 \% to 0.94 \%. The equivalent SNR overall was 46.5 dB $\pm$ 4.14 dB, ranging from 41.6 to 56.0 dB between subjects.
