\subsubsection{Impedance Spectrum Measurement}

Healthy brain tissue showed a non linear decrease of 15\% impedance over 0-250Hz, with ischaemic brain showing a decrease of 7 \% over the same range, with a more linear slope \ref{FigureSweep}. Above 250Hz, the impedance of both tissue types decreased at the same rate. These results were consistent with previous studies in the area \cite{Ranck_1963}, \cite{Logothetis_2007}.
