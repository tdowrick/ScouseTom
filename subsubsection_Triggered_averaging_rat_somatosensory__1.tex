\subsubsection{Triggered averaging - rat somatosensory cortex}

The baseline noise was 0.37 $\mu$V $\pm$ 0.048 $\mu$V or 0.009 \% $\pm$ 0.005 of the baseline. Significant impedance changes ($\delta$V $> 3\sigma$), a single injection pair example in figure \ref{EPDZ}, ranged from 1.20 $\mu$V to 18.7 $\mu$V (mean 3.97 $\mu$V), equivalent to 3.13 to 33.0 (mean 8.86) SNR. EIT reconstructions with this dataset show the onset at 7ms approximately 1 mm below the surface within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), before expanding to a larger volume reaching a maximum between 11-12 ms, figure \ref{EPRecon}, then spreading to adjacent areas and finally disappearing at approximately 18 ms. Using the reduced bandwidth of 250 Hz, the noise was 0.18 $\mu$V $\pm$ 0.06 $\mu$V or 0.004 \% $\pm$ 0.002 of the baseline.
