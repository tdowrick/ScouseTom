Despite the 8-fold increase in bandwidth and consequent noise increase, the performance of the ScouseTom system is comparable to that of previous systems \cite{Oh2011} with 0.37 $\mu$V $\pm$ 0.048 $\mu$V noise across all channels. Significant impedance changes (dV $> 3\sigma$), a single injection pair example in figure \cite{EPDZ}, ranged from 1.20 $\mu$V to 18.7 $\mu$V (mean 3.97 $\mu$V), equivalent to 3.13 to 33.0 (mean 8.86) SNR. EIT reconstructions with this dataset show the onset at 7ms approximately 1 mm below the surface within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), before expanding to a larger volume until reaching a maximum between 11-12 ms, figure \cite{EPRecon}, then spreading to adjacent areas and finally disappearing at approximately 18 ms.
