\subsection{Characterisation}
The frequency sweep mode of operation is effectively that of a dedicated impedance analyser, with the flexibility of addressing any pair of electrodes for current injection, and recording voltages on all electrodes in parallel. These results were consistent with previous studies in the area \cite{Ranck_1963}, \cite{Logothetis_2007}, and also allowed comparisons between two and four terminal measurements simultaneously.
