\subsection{Resistor Phantom - Frequency response}
[this is slightly confusing. WHy not start with the filter characteristics then introduce the measurements saying match filter charactetistic to within ... \%] The mean amplitude decrease, figure \ref{freqresp}, was 1.86 mV V or 21.0\%  from 20 Hz to 2 kHz for the BioSemi and 0.57 mV or 6.26\% for the actiCHamp across the same range. Across the full 20 kHz range the total decrease was 9.15 mV or  99.6 \%.  In both cases these frequency responses matched those of the anti-aliasing filter within the EEG systems, with cut-offs (-3dB) at 1.7 kHz and 7.5 kHz for the BioSemi and ActiCHamp respectively. Below these cut off frequencies, there was no significant change in mean SNR across frequency, ranging from 66 to 72 dB for the BioSemi and 69 and 75 dB for the ActiChamp.
