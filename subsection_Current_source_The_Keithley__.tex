\subsection{Current source}

The Keithley 6221 current source [give manufacturer details] is able to produce stable, low noise AC currents in the range 2pA - 100mA, up to a frequency of 100kHz; has a rated output impedance up to 1G\(\Omega\) supports external triggering and phase marking, and is controllable via serial, USB and Ethernet connections. The versatility of the system as a whole is largely as a result of this wide operating range of the Keithley 6221. This range covers the majority of EIT use cases, with the exception of those operating at high frequencies [always give figures even if approx as "High" means different things to different people], such as breast \cite{khan}.
