\subsection{Current source}

The Keithley 6221 current source (Keithley Instruments, Inc.) is able to produce stable, low noise AC currents in the range 2 pA - 100 mA, up to a frequency of 100 kHz; has a rated output impedance up to 1 G$\Omega$ supports external triggering and phase marking, and is controllable via serial, USB and Ethernet connections. The versatility of the system as a whole is largely as a result of this wide operating range of the Keithley 6221. This range covers the majority of EIT applications, with the exception of those operating at high frequencies $>$ 100 kHz, such as breast \cite{khan}.
