#Introduction

## Electrical Impedance Tomography
Electrical Imepdance Tomography (EIT) is a medical imaging technique which reconstructs the internal conductivity of an object from boundary voltage measurements \cite{Metherall1996}. Existing clinical uses of EIT include imaging the lung \cite{Frerichs_2000}, liver \cite{YOU_2009} and breast \cite{Halter}, and a number of EIT systems are now commercially available. Applications of EIT in the brain include imaging in epilepsy \cite{Vongerichten_2016}, \cite{Fabrizi_2006}, acute stroke \cite{Dowrick_2016}, traumatic brain injury \cite{Manwaring2013} and evoked potentials (EPs) \cite{Aristovich_2016}. It is also being developed for imaging fascicle activity in peripheral nerve \cite{KirillStockholm}. 

## EIT Hardware

A typical EIT system consists of a current source, voltage measurement unit, electrode array and some form of control/switching circuitry for automating the measurement process. A sinusoidal current of a defined amplitude and frequency is injected through a pair of electrodes, with voltages measured at all electrodes. Voltage recordings can be performed either serially, or in parallel on all electrodes. The process is repeated for a number of different pairs of injection electrodes, where the particular combination of injection electrodes is referred to as the protocol. The final data set consists of _n_ voltage measurements, where _n_ is equal to the number of injection pairs multiplied by the total number of electrodes. This set of measurements makes up a single frame of data and can be used to reconstruct a conductivity profile of the target object. More typically, the difference between two separate frames of data is calculated and used to image the change in conductivity over a certain period.

Existing EIT systems include the KHU \cite{Hun_Wi_2014} (16-64 electrodes, parallel voltage record, multiple pair injection, 11Hz-500kHz, 100 frames/s), fEITER \cite{McCann_2011} (32 electrodes, parallel record, single pair injection at 10 kHz, 100 frames/s), Dartmouth EIT System \cite{khan} (32 electrodes, 1kHz-1MHz, 100 frames/s), Swisstom Pioneer Set (32 electrodes, single pair injection at 50 kHz, 50 frames/s) and a number of systems previously developed at UCL \cite{Oh2011} \cite{McEwan_2006}.
