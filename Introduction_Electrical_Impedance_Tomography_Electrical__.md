#Introduction

## Electrical Impedance Tomography
Electrical Imepdance Tomography (EIT) is a medical imaging technique which reconstructs the internal conductivity of an object from boundary voltage measurements \cite{Metherall1996}. Existing clinical uses of EIT include imaging the lung \cite{Frerichs_2000}, liver \cite{YOU_2009} and breast \cite{Halter}, and a number of EIT systems are now commercially available. A range of applications of EIT in the brain have been proposed, including epilepsy \cite{Vongerichten_2016}, \cite{Fabrizi_2006}, acute stroke \cite{Dowrick_2016}, traumatic brain injury \cite{Manwaring2013} and evoked potentials (EPs) \cite{Aristovich_2016}, as well as the use of EIT for imaging activity in peripheral nerves \cite{KirillStockholm}. The ideal hardware requirements for these applications are not yet known and existing EIT systems, typically designed for imaging the organs of the torso, do not offer all of the capabilities required to identify them.

## EIT Hardware

A typical EIT system consists of a current source, voltage measurement unit, electrode array and some form of control/switching circuitry for automating the measurement process. A sinusoidal current of a defined amplitude and frequency is injected through a pair of electrodes, with voltages measured at all electrodes. This process can be repeated for a number of different pairs of electrodes, producing a set of voltage measurements which can be used to reconstruct a conductivity profile of the target object. Voltages recordings can be performed either serially, or in parallel on all electrodes. 
Existing EIT systems include the KHU \cite{Hun_Wi_2014} (16-64 electrodes, parallel voltage record, multiple pair injection, 11Hz-500kHz, 100 frames/s), fEITER \cite{McCann_2011} (32 electrodes, parallel record, single pair injection at 10 kHz, 100 frames/s), Dartmouth EIT System \cite{khan} (32 electrodes, 1kHz-1MHz, 100 frames/s), Swisstom Pioneer Set (32 electrodes, single pair injection at 50 kHz, 50 frames/s) and a number of systems previously developed at UCL \cite{Oh2011} \cite{McEwan_2006}.
