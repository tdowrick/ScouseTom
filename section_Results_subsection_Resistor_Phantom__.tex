\section{Results}
\subsection{Resistor Phantom - System Characterisation}
The average signal amplitude across all measurements and repeats was 2.66 mV $\pm$ .24 mV standard deviation. The noise in the first 100 frames was 0.356 $\mu$V $\pm$ .058 $\mu$V, equivalent to 0.013 \% $\pm$ .002 \% or 77.5 dB $\pm$ 1.3 dB SNR. 



As has been found with other EIT systems \cite{oh2007multi}, the long term noise increased, with 0.637 $\mu$V $\pm$ .064 $\mu$V or 72.4 dB $\pm$ 0.66 dB for one hour and 1.522 $\mu$V $\pm$ .205 $\mu$V or 64.9 dB $\pm$ 1.24 dB and four hour recordings.


As the short term SNR was unchanged throughout the recording when considering consecutive blocks of 100 measurements figure \ref{SNR}, this decrease in SNR 

%[this is interpretation which shouldnt be in results - ? correlated with] 

long term drifts from the baseline voltage. Over the course of the four hour recording, the mean change in voltage was 5.61 $\mu$V $\pm$ 1.04 $\mu$V or 0.21 \% $\pm$ 0.04 \%. 

%[again this is interpretation and shouldnt be in results - if you have measured data on these put here otherwise needs to go under discussion]. 

These arise predominantly from temperature changes within the current source, and variations in power supply voltage.

The reciprocity error was 0.42 \%.
