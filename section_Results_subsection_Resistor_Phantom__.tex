\subsection{Resistor Phantom - System Characterisation}
The average signal amplitude across all measurements and repeats was 2.66 mV $\pm$ .24 mV standard deviation. The noise in the first 100 frames was 0.356 $\mu$V $\pm$ .058 $\mu$V, equivalent to 0.013 \% $\pm$ .002 \% or 77.5 dB $\pm$ 1.3 dB SNR. The noise increased over the longer term, with 0.637 $\mu$V $\pm$ .064 $\mu$V or 0.024 \% $\pm$ .002 \% and 72.4 dB $\pm$ 0.66 dB for one hour, and 1.522 $\mu$V $\pm$ .205 $\mu$V or 0.17 \% $\pm$ .074 \% and 64.9 dB $\pm$ 1.24 dB and four hour recordings. As has been found with other EIT systems \cite{oh2007multi}, this decrease in SNR was not observed when considering each  consecutive block of 100 frames figure \ref{SNR}. Over the course of the four hour recording, the mean change in voltage was 5.61 $\mu$V $\pm$ 1.04 $\mu$V or 0.21 \% $\pm$ 0.04 \%. The reciprocity error (RE) was 0.42 \%.
