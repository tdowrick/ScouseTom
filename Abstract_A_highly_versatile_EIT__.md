#Abstract
A highly versatile EIT system, nicknamed the ScouseTom, has been developed. The system allows control over current amplitude, frequency, number of electrodes, injection protocol and data processing. A Keithley 6221 current source is used, along with a 24-bit EEG system for voltage recording. Custom PCBs interface with a PC to control the measurement process, electrode addressing and triggering external stimuli. The performance of the system has been characterised using resistor phantoms in experiments representative of human scalp recordings, with an overall SNR of 77.5 dB (n=343), stable across a four hour recording and from 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The ScouseTom can perform time difference, triggered, and multi-frequency EIT along with impedance spectrum measurements and has been successfully used in a range of experiments, including the imaging of stroke, epilepsy, evoked potentials and nerve activity. The experimental procedure is controlled by software and new paradigms can be easily implemented. All of the hardware designs and software for the system have been released under an open source licence, encouraging contributions and allowing for rapid replication.
