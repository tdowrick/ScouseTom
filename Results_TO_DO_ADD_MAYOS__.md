##System Characterisation
Resistor phantom measurements were carried out in order to assess the noise and drift characteristics of the system. The 32 channel Cardiff phantom \cite{griffiths1995cole} was used, configured to a purely resistive load.  Data was collected over four hours, with current injected at 2 kHz and 100 $\micro$ A, for 100 ms per measurement, similar to that used during recordings on the human scalp.  The resulting average signal amplitude across 122 measurement combinations and 4235 repeats was 2.66 mV $\pm$ .24 mV standard deviation. The noise was considered across three time intervals: 100 repeats (approximately five minutes) representing a typical short term measurement, and one and four hours. These longer recordings replicate the use of the system both in Triggered mode, as well as long term monitoring applications \cite{fu2014use} \cite{some lung one}


the mean noise value was **xx%/yymV** and drift was **xx%/yymV** over the entire period. The frequency response was measured over the range 1Hz-20kHz (**x** cycles at each frequency), with a current of **xxmA**. With a purely resistive test object, no change in voltage should be seen. The variation over the frequency range was **xxmV/yy%**.

##Modes/Experimental Data

Each of the modes of operation previously described have been used in experimental settings. 'Standard' time difference EIT data was collected for imaging stroke in a rat model \cite{Dowrick_2016} \ref{FigureStroke}. Using 100\( \mu \)A at 2kHz and ~60 injection pairs, a frame of EIT data was recorded every minute, over 30 minutes. A haemorrhage model was triggered at the 10 minute mark, after which voltage changes up to 20mV were observed.

Evoked potentials

Multifrequency EIT data was collected as part of clinical trial in collaboration with the Hyper Acute Stroke unit (HASU) at University College London Hospital (UCLH) **ref figure**. Stroke patients were fitted with 32 EEG electrodes **ref easycap**, and **x** injection pairs were used, with duration **y seconds**. Data was collected over a 30 minute period, at **x** frequencies between **y** and **zHz**, with amplitude **zmA**.

Impedance spectrum measurements have been made with the ScouseTom system \cite{Dowrick_2015}, where low frequency (<3kHz) impedance measurments were made on healthy and ischameic rat brain \ref{FigureSweep}. Impedance data was collected using a 100uA injection through two channels of a 30 electrode array, placed directly on the brain surface. The frequency was increased in 5Hz intervals from 1Hz to 100Hz, 10Hz intervals from 100Hz to 1000Hz and 50Hz intervals between 1000Hz and 3000Hz, with a minimum of 50 periods of the waveform recorded at each frequency. The frequency was swept from 1Hz-3000Hz, 3000Hz-1Hz and with random ordering. The use of an EEG recorder allowed parallel voltage recording at all electrodes, which were averaged together at each frequency.
