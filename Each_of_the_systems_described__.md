Each of the systems described were built primarily for EIT imaging of the organs of the torso, with little emphasis placed on capturing the data required for EIT imaging of the brain and head. While the optimal measurement paradigms for both fast-neural EIT and EIT of the head have not yet been established, the requirements for different experiments can be specified (table \ref{table_requirements}). In particular, the key requirements that are not implemented by existing EIT systems are the ability to simultaneously record additional data such as EEG and voltage drift alongside EIT data, and the ability to adjust the parameters of the signal processing pipeline depending on the requirements of the application.
