\subsection{Design criteria}
The design criteria set out initially were necessarily broad in order for the system to adapt to the four modes of operation successfully. The reconfigurability of the system meets these requirements in terms of range of injected currents, electrode count, synchronisation and recording of simultaneous EEG signals. 



The system meets with all the criteria described as a reconfigurable system adaptable to a variety of fast neural and brain EIT applications, whilst allowing for extensive control over the measurement setup and data processing. The utilisation of system in four main modes of operation has been outlined, facilitating EIT experiments into time imaging of stroke, multi-frequency stroke type classification, stimulation-triggered evoked potentials.
