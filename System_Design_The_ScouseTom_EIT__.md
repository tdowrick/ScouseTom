#System Design

The ScouseTom EIT system, figure \ref{STOverview} consists of a current source (Keithley 6221) and commercial EEG amplifier, alongside custom switching/control circuitry and software. Time and frequency difference EIT data can be collected, at frequencies between 5Hz and 20kHz, with a frame rate > 100 per second achievable.
