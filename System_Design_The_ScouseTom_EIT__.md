#System Design

## Hardware requirements
A typical EIT system consists of a current source, voltage measurement unit, electrode array and some form of control/switching circuitry for controlling the measurment process. A sinusoidal current, of a defined amplitude and frequency, is injected through a pair of electrodes, with voltages measured at all electrodes. This process can be repeated for a number of different pairs of electrodes, producing a set of voltage measurements which can be used to reconstruct a conductivity profile of the target object.


The ScouseTom EIT system consists of a current source (Keithley 6221), custom switch network & control circuitry, and EEG amplifer (BioSemi/actiCHamp/GTec)
