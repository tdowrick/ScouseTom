With the exception of those developed at UCL, the systems described were built primarily for EIT imaging in the torso, with little emphasis placed on capturing the data required for EIT imaging of the brain. While the optimal measurement paradigms for EIT of the head and fast-neural activity have not yet been established, an overview of the requirements for different experiments can be specified (table \ref{table_requirements}). In particular, the key requirements that are not implemented by existing EIT systems are the ability to simultaneously record additional data such as EEG, and the ability to adjust the parameters of the signal processing pipeline depending on the requirements of the application.
