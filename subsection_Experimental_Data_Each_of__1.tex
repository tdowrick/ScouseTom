\subsection{Experimental Data}


Each of the modes of operation previously described have been used in experimental settings. 

\subsubsection{Scalp electrode preparation}
The electrode preparation was the same in all scalp recordings

with 32 commercial EEG electrodes (EasyCap, Germany, www.easycap.de) configured using the standard EEG 10-20 \cite{Jasper1958} and 10-10 extension \cite{Oostenveld2001} systems. To apply electrodes, the skin was cleaned with alcohol and abraded before applying conductive paste [details ? Nu-prep and manuf details].
