\subsection{Multifrequency}
The stability of the system across frequency enabled recording of multi-frequency EIT datasets in stroke patients, as well as impedance spectroscopy type measurements to characterise stroke tissues. Whilst the imaging in these applications is still the subject of research \cite{malone2015} \cite{jang2015detection}, the datasets collected with this system constitute the most comprehensive recorded, and form a basis for future research. 

The decrease in average SNR compared to the recordings in subjects in section \ref{scalp} is largely a result of a greater prevalence of motion artefacts from patient movement.
