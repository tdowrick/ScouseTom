\subsection{Multifrequency}
The stability of the system across frequency previously demonstrated in the resistor phantom experiments was also present in recordings in stroke patients. 

The decrease in average SNR compared to the recordings in subjects in section \ref{scalp} is largely a result of a greater prevalence of motion artefacts from patient movement. 


Whilst the imaging in these applications is still the subject of research \cite{malone2015} \cite{jang2015detection}, the datasets collected with this system constitute the most comprehensive recorded, and form a basis for future research.
