\subsection{Time difference - imaging haemorrhage}
The noise in the baseline recordings (n=115 in N=15) before intervention was 0.64 $\mu$V $\pm$ 2.12 $\mu$V equivalent to 1.90 \% $\pm$ 3.6 \% or 42.4 $\pm$ 11.9 dB. The mean SNR per experiment (N=15) ranged from 28.4 to 62.1 dB. Over the 10 minute injection period, changes of 20.6mV \(\pm\) 5.4mV occurred (n=7) figure \ref{FigureStroke}, with a further increase of 2.2mV \(\pm\) 1.4mV over the remaining measurement time. The time course of the impedance change was consistent with the injection period of the blood into the brain. Physiologically representative localised impedance changes could successfully be reconstructed in 5 out of the 7 experiments, figure \ref{FigureStroke} b.
