noise in trig same as others - system not limit



Despite the 4-fold increase in bandwidth and consequent noise increase, the performance of the ScouseTom system is comparable to that of previous systems \cite{Oh2011} with 0.37 $\mu$V $\pm$ 0.048 $\mu$V noise across all channels.
 thus meeting the criteria outlined in section \ref{motivation}.

Images obtained previously with a 32 channel system by \citet{Aristovich_2016} with mechanical stimulation of the rat whisker which were found to be in good agreement with established literature, and cross validated with other imaging techniques both in initial onset \cite{armstrong1991thalamo}, and spread of activity \cite{petersen2007functional}. Whilst cross validation was not performed in this study, the literature is equally well established regarding forepaw stimulation, to which these images are in good agreement \cite{peeters2001comparing} \cite{masamoto2007relationship} \cite{lowe2007small}.
