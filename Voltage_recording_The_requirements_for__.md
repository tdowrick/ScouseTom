## Voltage recording
The requirements for voltage recording are parallel data collection, low noise and the ability to save data for offline processing. EEG amplifiers offer an effective off the shelf solution and a number of high performance systems are available \ref{table_eeg}. Each system offers a PC GUI for saving data to disk, data streaming over TCP/IP and the option to write custom software to interface with the device. One drawback of using an EEG amplifier is that the maximum sampling rate limits the EIT injection current to tens of kHz. For brain EIT, this is not an issue as the frequencies of interest are typically in the kHz range, but it may limit the use of the system in certain applications. For the experimental work presented here, either the BioSemi or actiCHamp system was used for voltage recording.

## Electrode Connectors

Standard 9 and 37 D-Sub connectors are used for internal connections within the system. Custom connectors/PCBs have been created to allow connection to a range of common electrode interfaces, including EEG electrodes, depth electrodes and Omnetics devices. Bespoke connectors and cabling can be added to the system for use with non-standard electrode arrays.
