\section{Conclusion}
The ScouseTom, a new highly versatile EIT system has been utilised successfully in a range of experiments, particularly those involving EIT of the head or nerve. A key advantage of the system is the high level of control it offers over all aspects of the experimental process. This versatility is as a result of the stable performance of the hardware across frequency and load, and adaptable modes of operation. The new system facilitated EIT experiments into time imaging of stroke, multi-frequency stroke type classification, stimulation-triggered evoked potentials. In all four modes of operation used, the performance of the system was comparable to, or exceeded that of existing systems in the literature. By incorporating commercial and open-source hardware and software where possible, the complexity in reproducing the system is minimised. All relevant schematics and software are available on an open source license, with reproduction and contribution encouraged.
